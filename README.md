# GoMES ðŸš§ WIP

A batteries-included framework for MES equipped with an event-driven namespace, ORM, and RESTful API toolkit.

## Motivation

GoMES aims to provide a simple, code-first template for MES solutions. The motivation is to decouple from platforms and to *hopefully* transition into a more open source approach within the integration industry.

## Vision for GoMES

- Open source and community driven
- Replacement for low-code/platform solutions ([MING](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/-ming-stack-introduction-influxdb/), [Ignition](https://inductiveautomation.com/ignition/), [Litmus](https://litmus.io/))
- Approachable in a way that integrators from all fields could use.
- Refactorable into *any* "server side" language
